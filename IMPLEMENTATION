Implementation Notes
====================

'Do' Blocks
-----------
    do <times | keyword 'forever'>
        ...

A block can run zero to 255 times or forever. Block ending is determined by
indendation. Each indentation step is four spaces long.

We need a stack because 'do' blocks can be nested. One memory line should be
reserved for stack offset and some memory area reserved for storing the stack.
Each line in the stack memory area will hold a counter for a 'do' block.

'To' Statements
---------------
    to <r g b> [and back] [in <time> [step <steps>]]

See 'test.dmx' for examples. Color values are integers between zero and 255. One
line per
statement. 

'Wait' Statements
-----------------
    wait <time>

Comments
--------
    -- <text>

Start a comment anywhere at a line with '--'. They and end at EOL.
