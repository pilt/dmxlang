Implementation Notes
====================

'Use' Blocks
------------
    use channel <channel>
        ...

Use a certain channel. See 'test.dmx' for an example.

We need a stack because 'use' blocks can be nested. One memory line should be
reserved for stack offset and some memory area reserved for storing the stack.
Each line in the stack memory area will hold a counter for a 'do' block.

'Do' Blocks
-----------
    do <times | keyword 'forever'>
        ...

A block can run zero to 255 times or forever. 

We need a stack because 'do' blocks can be nested. One memory line should be
reserved for stack offset and some memory area reserved for storing the stack.
Each line in the stack memory area will hold a counter for a 'do' block.

'To' Statements
---------------
    to <r g b> [and back] [in <time> [step <steps>]]

See 'test.dmx' for examples. Color values are integers between zero and 255.
One line per statement. Red value will be put at current channel + 1, green at
current channel + 2 and blue at current channel + 3.

'Wait' Statements
-----------------
    wait <time>

Comments
--------
    -- <text>

Start a comment anywhere at a line with '--'. They and end at EOL.
