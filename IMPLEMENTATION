Implementation Notes
====================
'Do' Blocks
-----------
    do <<times> times | forever>
        ...

A block can run zero to 255 times or forever. 

We need a stack because 'do' blocks can be nested. One memory line should be
reserved for stack offset and some memory area reserved for storing the stack.
Each line in the stack memory area will hold a counter for a 'do' block.

'To' Statements
---------------
    to <r g b> [and back] [in <time> [step <steps>]] [on channel <channel>]

See 'test.dmx' for examples. Color values are integers between zero and 255.
One line per statement. If no channel is given we will default to channel 1. Red
value will be put at channel + 1, green at channel + 2 and blue at channel + 3.

If we fade or step to a color we can macro expand the statement to a number of
immediate 'to' statement inbetween 'wait' statements.

'Wait' Statements
-----------------
    wait <time>

Comments
--------
    -- <text>

Start a comment anywhere at a line with '--'. They and end at EOL.
